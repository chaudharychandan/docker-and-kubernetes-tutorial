| Hello from Docker!                                                              |
| This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.      |
|                                                                                 |
| To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:                      |
|  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.                              |
|  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.       |
|     (amd64)                                                                     |
|  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the    |
|     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.              |
|  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it  |
|     to your terminal.                                                           |
|                                                                                 |
| To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:          |
|  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash                                                   |
|                                                                                 |

`-a` option is what's going to make docker actaully watch the output from the container and print out to the terminal
only `docker start <id>` is not going to show the output coming from the container out to the terminal
