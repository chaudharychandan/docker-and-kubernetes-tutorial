When we run echo as a default command with busybox it worked properly because echo is a program
that exists inside busybox fie system image. However with hello-world the only thing which exists in hello-world
file system snapshot is a single program which prints out the message. So the startup commands are based upon the
file system image included with the image and if run the program which is not included inside the file system of
the image it will throw an error.
