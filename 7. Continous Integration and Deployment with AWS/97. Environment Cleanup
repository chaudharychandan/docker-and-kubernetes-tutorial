Remember, we need to delete the resources we created or you might end up paying real money for them.  To clean up the Elastic Beanstalk instance we created, do the following:

1) Go to the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard, where you should see a page that looks like this:

2) On the top right hand side click the 'Actions' button

3) Click on 'Delete Application' then confirm the delete

Note: it might take a few minutes for the dashboard to update and show that your app is being deleted.  Be a little patient!
