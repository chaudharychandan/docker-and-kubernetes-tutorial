Quick Note for Windows Users
Section 6, Lecture 68
If you are running on Windows, please read this: Create-React-App has some issues detecting when files get changed on Windows based machines.  To fix this, please do the following:

In the root project directory, create a file called .env

Add the following text to the file and save it: CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true

That's all!

For more on why this is required, you can check out: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-start-doesnt-detect-changes
